  \textbf{Bring this checklist, annotated with ticks or question
    marks, a printout of your new schematics, and the schematics
    annotated at the schematic rewiew.}
\end{center}


\section*{Schematic}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Battery is fused before any other electrical connection

\item Battery has reverse polarity protection (hat board only)

\item 3.3\,V for game board is provided by LDO regulator connected to
  battery on hat board

\item Radio has power supply filtering

\item Game board RX pin (3) connected to SAM4S USART RXD (PA5, PA21), and TX pin
  (5) connected to SAM4S USART TXD.

\end{enumerate}


\section*{Silk screen layer}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Has group number

\item Has student names

\item Has clearly labelled test points

\item Has clearly labelled battery polarity for hat board

\item Has clearly labelled connectors  

\end{enumerate}


\section*{Mechanical}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Drill sizes meet requirements (min 0.3, steps of 0.1)

\item USB connector hangs over edge correctly
  
\item Radio antenna hangs over edge or there are cut-outs in the PCB planes  
\end{enumerate}

\pagebreak

\section*{Plane layers}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Has a ground plane
  
\item The ground plane is connected to the GND net

\item Has a power plane (this can be partitioned)

\item The power planes are connected to the appropriate power nets

\item Has cut outs for the radio antenna if the antenna does not hang
  over edge
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Signal layer}

\begin{enumerate}
\item All vias go from top to bottom layers

\item There are no long power/ground traces to planes (use more vias)
  
\item Large vias and wide traces are used for power/ground and
  high-current traces
  
\item IC pins are not connected between the pads
  
\item SPI, I2C, PWM, and UART signals do not run over gaps in a plane

\item SPI, I2C, PWM, and UART signals do not change layers more than twice

\item Ground test points are positioned for ease of use
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Design rule check}

\begin{enumerate}
\item There are no clearance violations when performing a design rule check

\item There are no trace width violations when performing a design rule check  

\item There are no unrouted nets  
\end{enumerate}  

Note, Altium gets confused with the pad to plane check when adding
decoupling caps, so ignore warnings with distances of 2.5\,m.
